  Here's where we're headed!  Of course, roadmaps are never set in stone, but this will at least give you an idea of
  what's in the pipeline.  Note that completed items are *not* listed.  To get a better idea of what's already finished,
  see the "Changes" links on the
  %a(href="/downloads.html")Downloads
  page.
